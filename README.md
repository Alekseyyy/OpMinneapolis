## And now, a message from Aleksey

okay if u managed to read this far, just realise that this is a shitpost and I would really advise that you __don't__ use this tool. Using proxies to relay ur DDoS is __NOT__ safe. ur probably better off using the [LOIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Orbit_Ion_Cannon), or just learning moar hacking and reading [Ivan Illich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Illich) or [bell hooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_hooks). Build you IT and critical thinking skillz first, then do some hacktivism. That's my tuppence wage, take it or leave it.
